E. Bozkurt and A. Ortega, "Non-Negative Kernel Graphs for Time-Varying Signals Using Visibility Graphs," 2022 30th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), Belgrade, Serbia, 2022, pp. 1781-1785, doi: 10.23919/EUSIPCO55093.2022.9909594

## Description:
This work concerns the Non-negative kernel graph construction technique for multi-channel EEG signals.
1. It is compatible with any similarity/distance metric
2. It works in a sliding window manner
3. It is a time-domain approach
4. Time shifts can be pre-computed, and possible delays between the time windows are addressed

## Dataset:
This work is compatible with any multi-channel EEG datasets. Some of the public datasets that are explored in this study :
1. IID vs TDV in MUSIC/REST states:
